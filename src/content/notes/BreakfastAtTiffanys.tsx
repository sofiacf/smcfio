    <p>Breakfast at Tiffany's is a super popular film, but I'm under thee impression that basically nobody understands
    it properly/appreciates its true genius. </p>
    <p>At the time, a friend was floating the proposition that "beliefs determine action", or "beliefs plus input
      determine action". We thought of the mind as a kind of function, performing a calculation with software of
      beliefs and hardware of brain. Something unaccounted for at the time was the physiological state of the body; it
      affects both the interpretation and response to "input" in a highly dynamic way. Reading books like Bessel van
      der Kolk's <cite>The Body Keeps the Score</cite> has made me aware of the physical responses to trauma and how
      they relate to healing. I recommend a read!</p>
    <p>This more holistic understanding helped me better understand and appreciate what I could gain from therapy.
      Therapeutic dialogue doesn't act directly on beliefs. The "facts" stated in therapy provide value as therapy,
      regulating the nervous system/emotions. The concepts may not persist, but the calming, grounding response
      creates space for moving on and reflecting in mindful safe ways. It's pretty nice, actually.</p>
