    A few mental health professionals and a kind relative have seemed concerned when I told them I'm not sure I
    deserve to live. People don't need to deserve to live; life is their inalienable right that will inevitably be
    taken from them. As my high school boyfriend's mother memorably once said, when he felt entitled to a school trip
    to India (he was, like, 16, don't judge too harshly!), <b>"There is no deserve."</b>
